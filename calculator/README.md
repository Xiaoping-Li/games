# Project: My Calculator
## Purpuse to write this App
When we write math expression, Infix Expression is used, for example: `1+(2-3)*4+20/5`, sometimes there are even more nested brackets in the Infix Expression. It's easy for us to figure out the operation priority, like calculate expression inside the bracket first, or calculate '*' and '/' first, then '+' and '-'. But this is pretty hard for computer to calculate in this way. But if we convert Infix Expression to Post Expression, then it's easy for computer.
